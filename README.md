* [Web Page!](https://bharatha21.github.io/WebPageAashish/WebTest/Vacations.html)
<br>
        When I look back on my WebPage, it is really cool to see how I was able to display my cool photos from all 
        the vacations I have been on, on to a web page. This was a big step for my understanding on how much I can 
        do with java and html. It also made me realize how much I am capable of doing much more.

##### Lightning Reflection
        Looking back on my Lightnig project, I remember how difficult it was to actually get the Lightning to appear
        on the screen. It was during this project that I became really comfortable asking for help when I was on the
        struggle bus. The project itself turned out good, although I might have to recheck my color schemes.
* [Dice](https://bharatha21.github.io/dice3/)
##### Dice Reflection
        Dice was one of my favorite projects we did all Tri, not only did I have fun while doing it but I figured it 
        out early and was able to tinker and make it better. 
* [Chemotaxis](https://bharatha21.github.io/chemotaxis4/)
#####  Chemotaxis Reflection
        Chemotaxis was rough. It was really funny how I got my project, at first I created a bunch of circle objects
        and then I just started playing aroudn with the randomizer and thats how * [Some Modern Art]  (https://bharatha21.github.io/PracticeChemo/) was created.

* tough code (code that's difficult)

```Java
void draw()
{
  background(85, 156, 198);

  while (endX<600) {
    stroke((int)(Math.random()*255)+1, (int)(Math.random()*255)+1, (int)(Math.random()*255)+1) ;
    endX=startX+((int)(Math.random()*10));
    endY=startY+((int)(Math.random()*19)-9);
    line(endX, endY, startX, startY);
    startX=endX;
    startY=endY;
  }
}
```
