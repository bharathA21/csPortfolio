 <p>
 When I look back on my WebPage, it is really cool to see how I was able to display my cool photos from all 
        the vacations I have been on, on to a web page. This was a big step for my understanding on how much I can 
        do with java and html. It also made me realize how much I am capable of doing much more.

Looking back on my Lightnig project, I remember how difficult it was to actually get the Lightning to appear
        on the screen. It was during this project that I became really comfortable asking for help when I was on the
        struggle bus. The project itself turned out good, although I might have to recheck my color schemes.

 <p>
Dice was one of my favorite projects we did all Tri, not only did I have fun while doing it but I figured it 
        out early and was able to tinker and make it better.

 </p>
 <p>
 Chemotaxis was rough. It was really funny how I got my project, at first I created a bunch of circle objects
 and played around with the randomizer(which crated Modern Art) and then I just messed around with it more to get my final result. I can   still make it better, but I like where I ended.

 <p>
 I really liked the college presentation project. It was cool to do research on colleges and learn more specifclly the comp sci department. It was also a really different expirence actually calling a proffessor, it's something I have never done before, but I am glad I did it.

  <summary>Starfield</summary>

 <p>
 Starfield was really fun, although it was difficult and confusing, I still had a good time doing it. I ended up doing an American themed project. The most difficult part was getting the ineritance and interface to work.

 <sumary> Final Reflections </summary>
 <p>
 1. My total reflection of the trimester is I had a really good time. My favorite part of this tri was how Dr.R gave us the freedom to do what we wanted with our code. I really l;iked it because it gave us an opportunity to make our code our own. In Starfield, I copied code from a processing database and I realised how it works in my code, but it taught me nothing. I learned that even though I may find myself on the struggle bus more times than not, it is the only way I will get better. With that aside, here is my toughest code from the tri. 
 </p>
 <p>
```Java
 for(int i =10;i<=560;i+=55){
    for (int j = 10;j<=560;j+=55){
    die = new Die(i,j);
     int dice=(int)(Math.random()*6)+1;
     count += dice;
  die.show(dice); 
 </p>
 <p>
 2. This isn't the toughest code that I can do, but this specific code was tough for me at the beginning of the Tri. This is because I was still getting back into the groove of coding, and refreshing my mind on for loops and the random method. It took me a while to get a handle of dice but using the internet, peers, and Dr. R really helped me get through the struggle.
